How to Build?
-------------
### Getting the source
- Making required directories
- Obtaining the repo binary
- Adding repo binary to your path
- Giving the repo binary proper permissions
- Initializing an empty repo
- Syncing the repo

Alright, so now we’re getting there. I have outlined the basics of what we’re about to do and broke them down as I know them. This is all pretty much going to be copy/paste so it’ll be fairly difficult to screw this up :)

##### Making directory for the repo binary

      $ mkdir ~/bin

##### Adding directory for the repo binary to its path

      $ PATH=~/bin:$PATH

##### Downloading repo binary and placing it in the proper directory

      $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

##### Giving the repo binary the proper permissions

      $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

To initialize your local repository using the ColtOS trees, use a 
command like this:

```bash
   repo init -u git://github.com/Colt-Enigma/platform_manifest.git -b c10
```
And, to make it sync faster, you can only sync the latest history:

```bash
   repo init --depth=1 -u git://github.com/Colt-Enigma/platform_manifest.git -b c10
```
  
Then to sync up:
----------------

```bash
   repo sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --force-sync -c
```
Finally to build:
-----------------

```bash
  First You need to add the following lines in your device tree's colt_devicename.mk file:

  TARGET_BOOT_ANIMATION_RES := 1080x1920 – Please change as per your device resolution

  # Inherit some common Colt stuff
  $(call inherit-product, vendor/colt/config/common.mk)

  For Colt's prebuilt APK please add the following:
  $(call inherit-product, packages/apps/ColtApps/common.mk)
 
and use the following to build:

  . build/envsetup.sh
  lunch
  *select your device*
  make colt
```
