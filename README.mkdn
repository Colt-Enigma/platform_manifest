ColtOS Project
===============
ColtOS Project is a team of learners and based on aosp with some customizations.


How to Build?
-------------
### Getting the source
- Making required directories
- Obtaining the repo binary
- Adding repo binary to your path
- Giving the repo binary proper permissions
- Initializing an empty repo
- Syncing the repo

Alright, so now we’re getting there. I have outlined the basics of what we’re about to do and broke them down as I know them. This is all pretty much going to be copy/paste so it’ll be fairly difficult to screw this up :)

##### Make directory for the repo binary

      $ mkdir ~/bin

##### Add directory for the repo binary to its path

      $ PATH=~/bin:$PATH

##### Downloading repo binary and placing it in the proper directory

      $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

##### Giving the repo binary the proper permissions

      $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

To initialize your local repository using the ColtOS trees, use a 
command like this:

```bash
  repo init -u git://github.com/Colt-Enigma/platform_manifest.git -b c10
```
  
Then to sync up:
----------------

```bash
repo sync -c -q --force-sync --optimized-fetch --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --prune -j$(nproc --all)
```
Finally to build:
-----------------

```bash
  First You need to add the following lines in your Device Tree's colt_devicename.mk file

  TARGET_BOOT_ANIMATION_RES := 1080x1920 : Please change as per your device resolution

  # Inherit some common Colt stuff.
  $(call inherit-product, vendor/colt/config/common_full_phone.mk)
 
  and use the following to build:

  . build/envsetup.sh
  lunch colt_[device-codename]-userdebug
  make colt
```

Help from other devices for making them Official
------------------------------------------------

If you got some commits missing in our sources for your device, let us know on our telegram chat. Everything else, it's up to you at the time of building.


Thanks & regards,
